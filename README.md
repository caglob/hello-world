# hello-world
My first thing


Hello! I am a (former??) college student that wants to to software engineering. I am generally in a wierd place in my life but
I have all the basics of OOP and Java down, so that still makes me a beginner, but I am extremely ready to learn! I hope to 
be a self taught software developer and go back to college one day. Is that vauge enough?
